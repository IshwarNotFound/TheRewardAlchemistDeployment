# requirements.txt for The Reward Alchemist

# ======================================================================
# == !! IMPORTANT INSTALLATION ORDER !! ==
# ======================================================================
# 1. Install PyTorch FIRST using the official command for your system:
#    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#    (Select OS, pip, Python, CPU/CUDA)
#
# 2. Install PyTorch Geometric packages SECOND, matching your PyTorch version:
#    https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html
#    (This often involves installing torch-scatter, torch-sparse first)
#
# 3. ONLY AFTER completing steps 1 & 2 successfully, run:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    (To install the libraries listed below)
# ======================================================================

# Core Data Science & Utility Libraries
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
joblib>=1.0.0
tqdm>=4.60.0 # Used in training script progress bars

# Web Framework & Server
Flask>=2.0.0
gunicorn>=20.1.0 # Production WSGI server for deployment (used in Procfile)

# NLP / Embeddings
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Networking (for artifact download)
requests>=2.25.0

# --- PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric (Placeholders - Install Manually First!) ---
# See IMPORTANT section above. These lines mainly document the need for them.
# The actual installation command depends heavily on your system (OS/CPU/CUDA).
# Example (Check official sites for current commands):
# torch>=1.13.0,<2.1.0  # Specify version compatible with your PyG install
# torch-scatter>=2.1.0 # Version depends on PyTorch/CUDA
# torch-sparse>=0.6.17  # Version depends on PyTorch/CUDA
# torch-geometric>=2.3.0 # Version depends on PyTorch/CUDA

# --- Optional (If reading .xlsx files directly) ---
# openpyxl>=3.0.0

# Note: For exact replication and guaranteed compatibility, it's best practice to
# activate your final working virtual environment and run:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# This will replace the >= constraints with exact == versions used in your setup.
